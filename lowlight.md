# 1. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE 19th + 20th CENTURIES 

### Readings:  early night photography
This is the first of several readings or virtual art lectures for class. Please study the concepts carefully and make notes on the artists presented, and what you might learn from them. (last names will be UPPERCASE). There is much to be learned by looking at the work of recognized artists and you will be asked to reference some of your choice in developing your own Final Project for the course.
This isn't an Art History course, though, so you are not expected to memorize these artists. You will, however, be expected to learn from them and then to refer to relevant artists in your own work. Do spend time looking at and thinking about what the photographer was trying to accomplish, and what the goals were. Look for works that resonate with you, or that challenge your thinking. Keep some notes.
We will look at a wide range of work in this course, most of it by artists who explored new ideas and techniques, took risks, and broke new ground, and so expanded our notion of what photography is. Usually interviews or critical texts are available for further study. We begin with a few 19th + 20th Century artists who explored the possibilities of photography in limited light, shooting in Black and White. Most are editorial or pictorial.
You may want to return to this week's collection of early B+W photography again in when we consider the use of long exposures and the role of time, and then when we consider the use of shadows and darkness to convey mood and drama. 

George BRASSAï (pseudonym of Gyula Halász b. Hungary 1899 - 1984) is best known for his photography as a participant observer in the demimonde of the early 20th century, made with a small plate camera and sometimes flash. The photographs were collected in the book ‘Brassaï: Paris de Nuit (Paris By Night).  Please read about him and see some of the better-known images in this 2018 NYTimes article

There won’t be any assignments requiring you to photograph the moon, stars, or other heavenly events in a conventional manner. For those who are interested, here are some notes and warnings. 

Night skies, dark skies

The night sky is changing. Even on a clear evening, few stars are visible in urban areas. Artificial light not only illuminates the ground, but also bounces back from the atmosphere. Perhaps the night sky will be a bit clearer this summer, thanks to reduced travel emissions during social distancing.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/06/10/light-pollution-keeps-much-of-humanity-from-seeing-the-night-sky/?utm_term=.c24386ccf9ab

One must travel quite a distance to escape urban and suburban light at night in our region.
This non-commercial organization dedicated to viewing stars and other phenomena maps remote locations where stars may be observed clearly, and has established dark sky parks.

Moon

During this course, the moon will be at its fullest the first weekend of July and the first week of August. Here is a link to a site that calculates a visual moon calendar for any month:

Ephmera App

At our latitude, the sun as well as the moon rise and set a different times every day. Here is a link to The Photographer's Ephemera, where you can obtain an app to calculate these times.  http://photoephemeris.com/about/

Lightning

We will have thunderstorms, no doubt, and they are dangerous. If you are tempted to shoot lighting, please read this first, for your safety. For the record, I do NOT expect anyone to try this and will not assign it. YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK

SAFETY:
Working at night outdoors can be dangerous. Always have an alert companion, who can also help you with your gear. Be aware of your surroundings as much as possible. 
We will have thunderstorms, no doubt. These are dangerous. If you are tempted to capture images of lighting, please read this first, for your safety! I am NOT assigning you to try this and you do so at your own risk.

PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020   Page Carr	1: Readings:  ISO, noise, camera motion, + Exercise 1



1. TECHNICAL BASICS + ISO TEST 
Noise, as you probably know, can be a challenge when shooting in low light. It can help to understand exactly what 'noise' is and where it comes from (a number of sources, in fact.) First, an overview of the basics, and more detailed readings with illustrations:

Signal to Noise Ratio

All electronic devices generate signals (desired information, usually) and noise that may obscure the signals, too. When the signal is clear, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is high. When the signal is weak and lost amid noise, the ratio is low.
The signal, in digital photography, is produced by light recorded by the sensor. Bright light provides a clear strong signal but in low light the signal is weak, and gets lost in the noise. 
Increasing the ISO value instructs the processor to amplify the signal to derive a clearer (brighter) image than it would at a lower ISO, but in that process, the ever-present noise is also amplified.
Where there is bright light and detail (producing a strong clear signal), the noise may be less apparent because the SNR is high in those areas. 
Digital camera processors have noise reduction (NR) built in. See if your camera has a setting to adjust the amount of noise reduction applied to jpgs in the camera. Too much noise reduction can blur or soften detail in an image. 
Some noise can be reduced in postproduction (Photoshop, for example), particularly Color and Luminance noise (see below)

ISO Processing

Remember that the sensor counts photons and records the count as numbers only (a Raw file), to which the processor assigns all visual qualities. 
The ISO is raised not by changing the sensor, but by changing the processing of the RAW file. At high ISO settings, if the sensor has received less exposure to light (the signal) the processor receives weaker image information. Since processing amplifies this weak signal to render an image that matches a normal tonal range, noise is also amplified. 

Kinds of Noise

Noise is most common in shadow areas of images made in dim light, and/or with low quality equipment. 
If you've done post processing you may already be familiar with the two kinds of noise that are most commonly adjusted in post processing:
Chrominance or Color Noise 
Affects color channels and appears as blotches of red, green, and blue especially in shadow areas. 
Luminance Noise 
affecting brightness, has a more consistent grainy texture overall, and reminds some of grain in film.
Noise can also be found in digital photographs made with long exposures in sufficient light, or in extreme ambient temperatures. 

Finally, as you may know, noise also depends on the camera sensor and processor.
Image noise may be generated in the camera itself, from fluctuations in signals, inaccuracies in processing, and defects in equipment. Noise can be characterized by appearance, for example random, fixed, or banded.

ISO Test for Noise

For class you will each run an ISO test for Noise, for your own camera, to know what to expect from your equipment and to consider the problem in depth. Please visit the following links first:

An explanation of how sensors work, by counting photons:
www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-sensors.htm
and then proceed to  these relatively simple technical explanations of noise in digital photography (please read both parts) 
www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-noise.htm
www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-noise-2.htm
A slightly more detailed explanation, with clear illustrations of the relationship between ISO, noise, and sensor design and performance can be found in this article, written for a popular audience:
dpanswers.com/content/tech_iso.php
And for those who are interested, a comprehensive explanation of light, sensors, and the many sources of noise (including photon shot, read, pattern, thermal, PRNU, and quantization error) may be found in the paper Noise, Dynamic Range and Bit Depth in Digital SLRs by Emil Martinec, 2008
http://www.photonstophotos.net/Emil%20Martinec/noise.html
Martinec’s explanations and illustrations of the different sources of noise and their visible characteristics are useful in identifying exactly what kind of noise is at issue. I do not expect you to memorize this information, just be generally familiar with the fact that noise is generated in a variety of ways, with characteristic patterns. 

Motion Issues

Most likely you will need to make long exposures for the ISO test. Any vibration during long exposures may blur detail. Using a tripod is one obvious control, but vibration can still be caused by pressing the shutter release and/or by the motion of mechanical parts of the camera.
To reduce vibration, you may
• use a SELF-TIMER to delay shutter release
• use LIVE VIEW, which locks up the mirror
• use a REMOTE CONTROL to minimize contact with the camera

During long exposures you won't have your eye to the viewfinder, and light can enter throw off the meter. You may cover it with a hat, or use an accessory that fits over the eyepiece. Read about EYE PIECE BLINDS here:
digital-photography-school.com/cover-your-eyepiece/
Or shoot in LIVE VIEW if you have it. This effectively blocks light from entering the viewfinder.
This Canon site offers some advice on long and timed exposures:
http://cpn.canon-europe.com/content/education/infobank/camera_settings/self_timer_and_timed_exposures.do
The following commentary provides one person’s views on the challenges of taking pictures in low light and with long exposures, including exposure trade-offs, mirror lock up, moonlight and moon movement, focusing, and metering. We will examine these issues for ourselves in the course, and consider other approaches as well. The technical explanations are simple, and example photographs are provided near the end, after the graphs.

PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020   Page Carr	1: Readings: Exercise 1  ISO test



EXERCISE 1:  ISO Test
Your goal in Part A is to test your camera's (or cameras') ISO range(s), and performance in low light to find out how high you can go without losing color quality or gaining unacceptable noise levels. 
Please conduct an ISO test for your camera, taking pictures of any suitable subject matter in some sort of limited light. This could be an indoor scene, a night image outdoors, or even a gray card or color test pattern in dim light. 
You will find it much easier if you choose lighting that does not shift or fade too much during the test, and in which most of the things are essentially stationary. 
Photograph the same scene in the same low light at your different ISOs, low to high. Do not use flash.
Your test should include both long and short exposures (slow and fast shutter) so you will need to use a TRIPOD. If your exposures are very long, remember that shooting in LIVE VIEW and using a TIMED or a remote control shutter release will reduce motion during the long exposure. 
As you change the ISO, remember to get reciprocal exposure values to obtain a consistent tonal range. REMINDER: This means you should adjust either shutter or aperture value (or both) as you change ISO to get the same Exposure Value and resulting tonal range. If you do not, the exposure value will change when you change the ISO.
You may find it useful to bracket your Exposure Values first, to determine what the best EV is, and then conduct the ISO test using reciprocal exposures at that EV.

For those who are not sure how to make a series of reciprocal exposures at different ISOs

The easiest way to do this is to
1. 	Make test exposures with the aperture at the widest f/stop and the camera's lowest ISO (200 perhaps) to find the best Exposure Value (use EV +/- if necessary). Refer to your histogram.
2. 	Determine the shutter speed that renders the best tonal range.
3. 	Make the first exposure in a series at that shutter speed.
4. 	Change the ISO to the next ISO by a full stop (for example, from 200 to 400) and change the shutter speed by one full stop (shorter, for example from 1/15 to 1/30 second) to compensate and get the same EV / same tonal range. The Histogram should be nearly the same in each frame. Manual mode is best, but if you do not know how to use manual, use Aperture Priority and let the camera change the shutter speed for you.  
5. 	Do this for each ISO you have in full stop intervals (200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and so on) In other words, all the exposures should be at that same f/stop while changing ONLY the shutter speed by full stop intervals (shorter and shorter time values) each time you change the ISO by a full stop.

You can only upload jpg files to Flickr. You may capture in RAW if you have it and know how to make jpgs for Flickr, (or if you don't, shoot in RAW+JPG or only JPG) but please do NOT post-process. What matters is what you get in-camera. Please do not use any in-camera effects.  
Here is the link again to the sample test set I showed in class. Note that the images are all of essentially the same tonal range and Ev.
http://www.flickr.com/photos/pagec/sets/72157617981926973/

You will learn more if you try more than one subject and lighting situation. 
If you conduct more than one test, you can show us just one, plus the others if you wish.
Examine your results closely, inspecting and comparing shadows, highlights, details, continuous tone, color, and texture. You will need to do this in Bridge or Lightroom or some other application that allows you to enlarge the image. Notice the pattern and texture of the noise, and try to identify it as random, fixed, or banded.


 
PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020   Page Carr	1: Readings: Submit Exercise 1  ISO test


TO SUBMIT YOUR WORK

Please do not post-process the tonal range of your images, or reduce noise in post. You are testing what your camera produces. If you shoot in RAW, you will need to generate jpgs for Flickr but please do so without tonal or noise corrections. If you wish to balance color in post, please produce a separate set of color-corrected jpgs and identify them as such. 
Please upload 10-20 images to Flickr in an album. 
See topic below for instructions on HOW TO MAKE AN ALBUM . For the ISO test, please put the images at each ISO in sequence by ISO. Here is a link to a sample album:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/pagec/albums/72157650901311994

From the images you put on Flickr, choose ONE image to add to the group pool. From that image we can go to the rest. Please have it in an album with the other images in the test.

TITLE pictures with your last name and the exercise number. for this first exercise, use LASTNAME 1A This is required for any image you send to the group or submit for grading at midterms.

WRITE explanatory notes referencing the exercise you shot them for. Notes are required for any image you send to the group or want credit for at midterms.

After sending your own work to the group, spend time looking at your classmates’ work before class. Please DO NOT comment on their work until after I have left a comment, and in any case do NOT leave empty comments such as 'great photo' or 'I like this'. 

If you have Photoshop, Bridge, and or Lightroom at home, please have some of your files handy when we meet in Zoom. I will demonstrate noise reduction via screen-sharing in Zoom. If you like, follow along. I may allow some time during class in zoom to try it, and you can screen share. This is optional because some students won’t have the softward.

2. BUILT LANDSCAPES, ARTIFICIAL LIGHT, and SOCIETY

Our urban, suburban, and even rural nighttime landscapes are changing. Public lighting, brighter and more widespread than in the past, is associated with changes in lifestyle and community expectations, and concerns for public safety balanced against desires for an opportunity to experience an undisturbed, natural world by night. To some, brilliant lighting by night is a relief, for others it is light pollution, an annoyance or even a disaster. This artificial illumination of the night has changed the night sky. It also changes photography on the ground.

Tim DAVIS (b. 1969, Malawi) explored retail parking lots, hoping, he writes ‘to see LOTS of information there: sculptural, painterly, glowing, effluorescing ways in which a non-place could become a garden of earthly delights.’

Todd HIDO (b. 1968, Ohio) in his documents of suburban residential locations at night. Note how the few lights evoke a mood or suggest activities within the houses. 
http://www.toddhido.com/homes.html
Hido’s approach is often to travel to a new, unfamiliar location and stay for days, to simply absorb its character as he photographs.

Michael VAHRENWALD (American) comments on ideas about darkness, sameness, and mood in his series of standard retail development sites. In his statement for Universal Default, he says 'The photographs in the series Universal Default are taken in the empty, outer lying spaces of newly constructed ‘big box’ stores across the United States. Lit by the ambient glow of modern parking lot lights, the borders that separate the empty spaces of agriculture from suburban commercial architecture are illuminated. The camera records an enigmatic and tragic reality that appears fictitious. '

Stephen TOURLENTES (b. 1959, Illinois) explores sociopolitical issues, namely the prison system. His nighttime landscapes of penitentiaries at first may seem either surprising or ethereal, possibly at odds with what we may think prisons look like. In fact, they are brilliantly illuminated night and day, and blaze against dark skies in remote locations.

Edgar MARTINS (b. 1977, Portugal) also considers the social significance of the built landscape lit by artificial light, presented with visual drama, but little emotion. Of his series The Accidental Theorist Martins writes:
“Shot largely on the same set of beaches in Portugal over a period of two years, the imagery of The Accidental Theorist is a

series of instants that have become independent of reason or purpose..This landscape is familiar, ubiquitous, and yet imaginary, unreal. It is full of stillness and silence yet the pervasive tranquillity is not reassuring but discordant, inconsistent, intangible..All that typifies the holiday beach experience is missing. There is an overwhelming sense of the theatrical and the melancholic..The beach is rendered as little more than a proscenium awaiting some event.”
http://www.edgarmartins.com/work/the-accidental-theorist/?show=photographs
He explores abstract structure in certain unusual airport runways in 'When Night Casts no Shadow'. In his statement he notes a metaphor in the work “In reflecting on the complexity of the negotiations between estranged lives and de-territorialized worlds, one might wonder if the generic city is synonymous with the contemporary airport.
Immured in temporality and suffering from a sense of historical discontinuity, the airport is the elementary expression of abstract space. It renders everyone weightless. It is the space of the uprooted.”
http://www.edgarmartins.com/work/225/?show=photographs
In 'A Metaphysical Survey of British Buildings' there is in the empty training facility a reference to ‘the modern asocial city’ “These images depend on photography’s inherit tendency to make each space believable, but there is a disturbing suggestion that all is not what it seems. This process of slow revelation and sense of temporal manipulation is crucial to the work.”

Jason FALCHOOK (b. 1977, NYC) documents urban or built landscapes, too, with an interest in the structures that link places, some at night, others early in the morning, but with a more personal, experiential approach. His statement describes this work as depicting '. . . a landscape in continual transition, a world caught between the debris of the industrial past and the promise of a more austere, technological future.'

Dan HOLDSWORTH (b. 1974, England), has examined built landscapes, in several series. See his (A Machine for Living) series, Autopia series, and Megaliths (each of the following pages includes several images. Click on the first one to see the following)

2. TEMPORAL DIMENSION Part 1: Long Exposures in existing Low light 

The fact that photography requires a certain amount of time, or a duration, has influenced photographers since it's invention. Because the emulsions were slow to react to light, exposures were many hours long. 
 (If you are unfamiliar with this early history of the invention of photography, please review the brief summary found here: 
http://www.photo-museum.org/photography-history/
http://www.photo-museum.org/niepce-invention-photography/
http://www.photo-museum.org/daguerre-invention-photo/
http://www.photo-museum.org/niepce-nicephore-daguerre-physautotype/
With improvements in emulsion speeds, faster shutters could be used, eventually surpassing the speed at which the ye can distinguish a discreet moment in time. Things could now be seen in photographs as never before humanly possible.

Think about what is recorded in a thousandth of a second, or in a thousand seconds. Consider the following examples of work by artists who have explored the meaning and effect of LONG EXPOSURES, and our understanding of Time. . .

Hiroshi SUGIMOTO (b. 1948, Tokyo) has pushed his long exposures to examine aspects of his subjects that would not be apparent to the eye. His best known work in this regard are his exposures made in movie theaters for the duration of the projection of the film, 90 minutes or more. The grand architecture is delicately illuminated by the light on the screen. Sugimoto also explored darkness and its mysteries in other projects, such as long exposure seascapes.
On this site, look at these sections from two series and read the short texts:
https://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/new-page-7/
https://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/seascapes-1/

American artist Chris McCAW also has used extremely long exposures including imprints on photosensitive paper directly exposed to the moving sun. The lens focused the sun's image so intensely that it burned the paper:

Last year an exhibit of contemporary photography 'Memory of Time' at the National Gallery of Art included a section called Time Exposed, which included work by two of the artists listed above (Sugimoto and McCaw).
http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/features/the-memory-of-time/time-exposed.html

Michael WESELY b. (1980, Munich) extends his exposures for days, weeks, and months. Such long exposures in daylight may be achieved by use of neutral density filters as well as slow film and small apertures, all of which can slow the rest of the exposure process.

A photojournalist by training, Alexey TITARENKO (b. 1962, Leningrad) used long exposures to ‘illustrate links between the present and the past” in Russia” in City of Shadows”. Consider what sort of visual documentation these long exposures might provide.

EXERCISE 2 
LONG EXPOSURE WITH EXISTING LIGHT

This is one of two exercises this week. You are welcome to do both in the same session, IE with some of the same elements.

After studying the artists discussed above, think about changes that occur over time and experiment with very long exposures to record these changes in AVAILABLE light (no added flash etc, that will be for Exercise 3). 
Try exposures of several seconds at least and several minutes if possible. Dim overall light, low ISOs, tripod, and Neutral Density or polarizing filters might all be useful.
Remember to:
1.  Choose a scenario or subject with elements that move or change over time and during the exposure, to explore those changes through time in your subject or scene. This could be changes in the light itself. You might want to try things that change or move at different speeds. Remember that rapidly moving things may disappear completely in long exposures.

2. Plan to test different Time, Aperture, and ISO values with your moving subject matter to determine which works best. 

3.  Keep careful records of these tests and the shooting circumstances as you determine what exposures will record the changes in dim light. You may shoot this in near darkness or dim / minimal light.
Note that during very long exposures, light may enter via the view finder. You may cover it with a steady hand or a hat, or use an accessory that fits over the eyepiece. This Canon site offers some advice on long and timed exposures:
http://cpn.canon-europe.com/content/education/infobank/camera_settings/self_timer_and_timed_exposures.do
Be sure to keep notes.
Upload a representative selection of experiments to your Flickr account, at least 10 jpgs, and send one to the group to signal that it’s done, with clear explanatory notes on your thinking and technique. We will look at the other images later.

3: TEMPORAL DIMENSION again:  Long Exposures with Supplemental Light

ADDING LIGHT TO TIME
Adding light using multiple strobes or other sources during long exposures is now a common practice in commercial photography, and so-called 'painting with light' is a popular amateur genre. Googling 'painting with light', 'drawing with light', 'light calligraphy' will turn up many. Sometimes it can become a group activity. 
www.rit.edu/cias/bigshot/
and this is the image Bob Laubach and some Nova students participated in:
bigshot.cias.rit.edu/big-shot-number-25/
The possibilities of adding light during long exposures have also been explored by contemporary artists, journalists, and scientists. For exercise 2B, please think about the concepts and discoveries possible, BEYOND drawing with light for fun. Perhaps the following, along with the artists in 2B, will get you started thinking (I will add other sorts of content when I can find good links):

The artist Gary SCHNEIDER (b. 1954 South Africa) adds light to his subject during long exposures. Look at these very long exposures, of a face illuminated in parts using a small flashlight. 'John in Sixteen Parts'
www.garyschneider.net/Portfolio_main.cfm?nK=7858&i=88427	continues
 
 
PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020    Page Carr	2. Readings: More temporal dimension, cont.


 In an essay considering a number of theoretical issues of time duration in photography in general, and about Gary Schneider in particular, you may at least get a sense of how much Time has been debated in regard to Photography. (The essay references theorists you are not expected to be familiar with.) The author writes about Schneider, "the long exposure produces these moments on a single frame. It is as if the frames are accumulating to provide a depth of time on a single image rather than a movement through space and an extension onto a series of successive frames. The long exposure can present a continuity of any-instant-whatevers rather than a selected privileged moment. While not presenting an actual movement in time, the photograph can represent the movement that occurred in its duration. The long exposure traces a continuity of movement (albeit without animation). The long exposure not only extends the time of the photograph, it reveals that time in its image. '
www.rhizomes.net/issue23/plummer/index.html

Italian artist Roberto BOCCI has used supplemental light in extended scenarios including nudes (which you are not required to view) exploring states of mind and experience in seizure episodes and similar events. These were shot in extremely low light using long exposures and supplemental lighting.
https://www.robertoboccifoto.com/bath-tubs/
https://www.robertoboccifoto.com/interiors/


TRACING TIME + SPACE

Some long exposures by night record patterns traced over time that we cannot see at once. LED lights have explained the possibilities of such time + space images by night. These can also be breathtakingly beautiful. 
Recently, the artist Duke RILEY (b. 1972, Boston) released homing pigeons carrying led lights, over New York City in Fly by Night, as a public art event. See the still image in the Guardian
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/may/07/pigeons-led-lights-duke-riley-new-york-pictures
and see this video documenting the project, Note in particular the images about 10 minutes into the video:
http://creativetime.org/projects/flybynight/

Lia HALLORAN (b. 1977, USA) uses long exposures of skaters with lights attached to record movement through space as well as time. A statement on her site says she 'often makes use of scientific concepts as a starting point and explores how perception, time and scale inform the human desire to understand the world and our emotional and psychological place within it.'
www.liahalloran.com/dark-skate-vienna/
Look at other examples under 'Photography' in the menu bar.

In a similar vein Stephen ORLANDO's long exposures of kayakers reveals the complex patterns of their action:
http://www.boredpanda.com/kayaking-long-exposure-light-painting-photography-stephen-orlando/

And such techniques have been used for many kinds of editorial illustration. Look at how LED lights were used to dramatize motion and form of trams in Budapest, in these photographs by Krisztian BIRINYI:
www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/06/budapest-trams-long-exposure/

Photographer Simon NORFOLK used flames during long exposures to illustrate a story on shrinking glaciers
www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/magazine/mount-kenyas-vanishin...

And scientific research and development makes use of such lighting over time with sometimes unexpected aesthetic results. Immaterials: the ghost in the field

Bioluminescence
An amateur photographer in Japan, Tsuneaki HIRAMATSU, has received widespread recognition for dazzling images of 

firefly trails by night. Note how the blinking lights are recorded as dotted lines, measuring the time it took them to fly where
they did. They are both informative and decorative.
http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2012/02/japanese-firefly-photos-and-the-anatomy-of-a-viral-spread/

Artist Gregory CREWDSON also photographed fireflies, in Black & White
https://hyperallergic.com/128734/black-and-white-photographs-of-fireflies-lighting-up-summer-nights/


KINETIC photography
Finally, one can move the camera, instead of the lights. The link below illustrates decorative and entertaining possibilities of a popular technique. Might there be more meaningful ways one might move the camera instead of the lights, to reveal something significant about motion through time and space?
http://www.cameratossing.de/JensLudwig/Camera-Toss-HowTo/page38086.cameratoss


EXERCISE 3
LONG EXPOSURE WITH ADDED LIGHT

This is the second of two exercises this week. You are welcome to do both in the same session, IE with some of the same elements. 

Experiment with very long exposures of something illuminated with SUPPLEMENTAL (added) light, such as a flash unit, a flash light, a flashing light, or some other light source during long exposures, meaning 5 seconds or more. You can add the light through space towards and away from the camera, for example, as well as over time. You might even turn exisiting lamps on and off, or other sources of light that are present. There are many possibilities.
Recommend you think about your ideas first, and then experiment and see what you can do.
Consider the works of artists you’ve studied, and use your imagination and intellect to make meaningful images. The techniques explored in class are only a starting point, not an end in themselves.

PLEASE DO MORE THAN simply make random or cute marks with light. Think about the significance of the light, the time value, and the form of the illumination. In what direction are you moving the light? It can move in any angle through the space in front of the camera. Look again at the examples in the readings for ideas. 
Keep the temporal aspect of your idea in mind, too. For example, choose a certain interval of time for a reason.

REMEMBER TO
Bracket exposures to find the EV that works.
Keep notes.
Upload a representative selection of your experiments to an album, and send ONR to the group with explanatory notes. Refer to your notes on what you did with the light source.
You may share images from the warm up exercise in class, too, but for credit you must make your own images after class.
Begin thinking about which of these exercises interests you, with your final project in mind.

Secrets, Surveillance, and Surreptitious photography

Surveillance cameras form a record that is objective and convincing in a way somewhat different from evidence images. We tend to believe a grainy, indistinct surveillance image because it must be the best available of that subject. Surveillance imagery can be voyeuristic, or even an invasion of privacy.
An Exhibit at the Tate Modern examined these themes (includes a video discussion of the exhibit)
http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/exposure/default.shtm

in the mid 20th c, Walker EVANS (1903-1975, USA), using a hidden camera, surrepticiously photographed riders on the NY subway  http://mrod.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/walker-evans-subway-photography/

Compare these to Bruce DAVIDSON's subway images, several decades later, and shot late at night
https://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&ALID=2K7O3RJSJ42A

Photographer Merry ALPERN (b. 1955)  also photographed her subjects surrepticiously, but unlike Evans's subway passengers, hers were engaged in illicit activity, apparently unaware that they might be in anyone's view
http://www.artnet.com/artists/merry-alpern/

Conceptual artist Sophie CALLE (b. 1953, France) has explored voyeurism, following subjects and taking pictures, much as a private investigator might. She has also orchestrated such documentary projects, and even arranged to be followed and photographed herself. Look at Les Dormeurs (1983) and read the explanatory text from the exhibit at Berkeley
http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/program/sophie-calle-matrix-133

Contemporary artist Jill MAGID (b. 1973, USA) explores our relationship with ubiquitous surveillance cameras, often in video. In Evidence Locker, she herself is recorded city police surveillance cameras (not all at night)
http://www.jillmagid.net/projects/evidence-locker-2

Artist Shizuka YOKOMIZO (b. 1966, Tokyo), in her 'Stranger' series, mimics voyeurism by asking her subjects to participate, and pose for her. Try the link below, and/or google her name and the series title.
http://theharlow.net/shizuka-yokomizo-dear-stranger/

Stephen TOURLENTES series of night landscapes of prisons lit up as brightly as day (mentioned in readings on the Built Landscape) could be considered a kind of surveillance work.
http://www.tourlentes.com/Stephen_Tourlentes_Web_site/Photographs.html

Trevor PAGLEN, an artist and geographer, makes surveillance photographs for art and political purposes, some by night. Here is a work shot by moonlight  http://www.paglen.com/?l=work&amp;s=theywatchthemoon
In another project, PAGLEN makes use of popular “star trails” techniques for a larger purpose than producing striking visuals. In his series “The Other Night Sky” he attempts “to track and photograph classified American satellites, space debris, and other obscure objects in Earth orbit”:

PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020    Page Carr	3. Readings  Emotional dimension

Darkness, Drama,  + Mood

PLEASE REMEMBER TO READ BOTH TOPICS THIS WEEK
Many photographers speak of trying to communicate a feeling in their work. When light is limited, one's senses are often heightened. The term 'dark mood' suggests an unsettling, worrisome, or challenging frame of mind. 
Darkness can also suggest other conditions and moods: retreat, meditation, peace and quiet. Most people sleep better with the lights out.
Here below are a number of photographers who create mood with darkness, or during darkness. 
Please also review the works in two other topics in flickr for class: 2. The Built Landscape, Artificial Light, + Society  and   3. Secrets + Surveillance: Surrepticious Photography, As you do, give attention to the role of darkness, mood, and drama.
Wall text for the exhibit Dark Matters at the Hirshhorn Museum commented on darkness this way 'Darkness is a lack, the absence of light. It evokes notions of mortality, silence, solitude, and loss. Violence may also lurk in the dark, and we dread the unexpected encounter in an unlit space. But darkness can equally symbolize the wiping clean of the slate, a renewal. As darkness absorbs light, it absorbs our gaze, engendering feelings of timelessness and infinity'
The first examples are of work by several contemporary artists who explore the dramatic and psychological aspects of photography in low light. All been attracted to the same subject general matter (water), but with different intents and ideas, and different results. Note their range of emotional impact.
https://hirshhorn.si.edu/explore/hirshhorn-presents-dark-matters-selections-from-the-collection/

Roni HORN (American, b 1955), one of the artists included in the Dark Matters exhibit, researched and photographed the waters of the Thames River, as a commemoration of those who had drowned there. 
http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/horn-no-title-p13057
Notice the foot notes on the images, which are as much poetry as information. If you are interested, these are currently on exhibit at the private collection Glenstone, as reviewed by Kriston Capps. (Horn works in many different media)
http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/museums-galleries/blog/20858149/roni-horn-at-glenstone-reviewed
and this video may provide a broader context
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7VIdtyRc60

Compare Horn's studies of water with those in Hiroshi SUGIMOTO's Seascapes (which you also looked at in Week 2) His particular locations are also selected deliberately, but taking a wider view and including an horizon line in the same part of each frame. Does this change the mood or message of the images for you?
http://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/seascape.html

Nicholas HUGHES's series of studies of water at night, and also trees and other subjects, evoke moods specific to place and are structured as visual poetry. Like Horn and Sugimoto, he used large format film cameras, but unlike Horn and Sugimoto, the history of the location is not as important as its mood. - See  Darkness Visible verses I and II, and Field verses I and II
http://www.nicholas-hughes.net/indarkness_image_1.htm  and  http://www.nicholas-hughes.net/field_image_1.html
and  http://www.nicholas-hughes.net/field2_image1.htm
In his biography on the site, Hughes describes his intent as “In reaction to media led sensory anaesthetisation, and wearied by empty political rhetoric, my aim was to construct a forest built from accumulated memory and the ghosts of trees. Spending a period of two winters’ visiting public spaces in central London, this work inverts decorative Arcadian layout in an attempt to restore a sense of the natural in the cultivated, somewhat synthetic city ‘wilderness’ spaces.”    
http://www.nicholas-hughes.net/biography.htm

Melissa FLEMING: her Sentient series is also about water. she says in her statement:
“The ocean is simultaneously dangerous and beautiful. I was attracted to this duality and began to photograph the waves at night, a time when the ocean feels the most unknown and un-navigable. Although the ocean is physically the same at night as it is in the day, our perception of it changes in the dark. Unable to see the water at night, we feel uncertain of our surroundings. Even photography, a medium of light, captured only the white crash of waves, the lone visible sign of the

water in the darkness. The white seemed sentient and in a sense was the mark by which we could know the ocean at night. Waves visualize the power of the ocean and in the black void of night the swirls of white in Sentient hint at that unseen energy we know in our minds to be present.”    
http://www.melissafleming.com/gallery.html?gallery=Sentient

Noelle TAN's series of nightscapes in B+W give up all shadow detail, to surround an illuminated subject in darkness
http://www.civilianartprojects.com/artists/tan/un-13.html

Martina HOOGLAND IVANOW ( b. Stockholm, 1973), a commercial photographer who has recently begun working as a contemporary artist, includes figures in suggested narratives or dramas. Some are shot in low light, some not, but most have a dark mood, or a quality of indistinctness we might associate with darkness. Consider how much of the mood is the result not just of darkness but of the color and exposure, and use of film (possibly Polaroid). Look at Far Too Close, Elephant and Castle, and Speedway.
https://www.martinahooglandivanow.com/books

Gregory CREWDSON is also known for his theatrical productions, using an approach that is well outside our focus in this course (you may read about his complicated process in one of the links) but consider the cinematic mood he is after, and how it might be achieved without the artificial lighting and post processing effects:
http://www.aperture.org/crewdson/
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5157819
http://www.gagosian.com/artists/gregory-crewdson/

Artist Caitlin CRONENBERG devises similarly theatrical and cinematic narratives performed by actors, but with more frames in the sequences:
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/17/sunday-review/19exposures-cronenberg.html

Editorial Drama

Photojournalists record scenes and events indoors and out, night and day. Shooting by available light conveys more closely the look of people, places and things. 
In this recent long form story by New York Times photojournalist Andrea BRUCE, notice how dim lighting and lighting at night create a mood or sense of place, as well as time of day.
http://wap.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/05/18/world/asia/20130519-PAKISTAN.html?from=slideshows

Photojournalist Adriana GROISMAN (b. Buenos Aires) has documented Tango couples,  in a stylized black + white cinematic narrative approach that echoes 20th century works,
http://www.adrianagroisman.com/tango/index.html   and    http://www.adrianagroisman.com/tango2/index.html

Look at the work of New York Times photojournalist Damon WINTER. On his site 
look under Stories, for example, Stories1: 3 and 4, and Stories2: 1,2, 3 and 4, which all include many lowlight scenarios. Consider how shadow and darkness convey emotion (or do not) and what factual information is delivered along with the drama.   http://www.damonwinter.com

Please also review the works in two other topics in flickr for class The Built Landscape, Artificial Light, + Society, and Secrets + Surveillance: Surreptitious Photography. As you do, give attention to the role of darkness, mood, and drama.




 
PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020    Page Carr	3. Emotional Dimension Exercise 4


EXERCISE 4
Create a dramatic or psychological mood ( exciting, serene, dreary, upbeat, morose, scary, gentle, suspenseful, romantic, unsettling, soothing, whatever) using darkness, and the drama of low light. Please upload several different experiments, for a total of at least ten, to Flickr. Send one to the group with explanatory notes in the description of the mood you were after and your decisions as the photographer.

HEADS UP:
Remember you will be asked to turn in a Midterm album consisting of the strongest image from each exercise 1 - 4. See the topic for more information.
The next exercise will be to begin your final project.
Make exploratory or sample images for your Project, to go with a brief proposal. Please read and carefully consider the points made in the flickr Topic for final Project Proposals. Test your proposal idea and get started working on it, and show us sample images of what it will be like. 


MIDTERMS Submit #1 - 4
Please put a tight selection of your strongest work (one per exercise, up to two) in an album in Flickr and arrange the images in sequence by exercise number, 1 - 4. One image is enough to represent the exercise. The rest of your work for each exercise should be in an album where we can see it.)
Instructions for making albums are below.
Yes, you may revise any work that could be better than what I have seen so far, and be sure to respond to comments I have left. When your best work is ready for me to look at, please submit it by copying the URL from the browser bar for the the Album, and paste it as a reply in this topic. I will be able to see your flickr identity next to the link.
Please make sure the link goes to the album, not the organize feature.

HOW TO MAKE ALBUMS

'Albums' also known as sets are in effect folders of images that you may filter from your photostream, not unlike collections in Lightroom. They appear on your home page (you may look at mine as an example). If I accidentally call albums 'sets, forgive me, as the name was changed abruptly this Spring.

For class, you will assemble your work by putting images in an album of your exercises at Midterms, and your Project in another at the end of the course. It will be helpful to also have additional examples of your efforts for the exercises in separate albums so I can easily see what else you did.

There are several ways to put your images in albums / sets.

When UPLOADING, you can make and name or add to an album, to get started.
When looking at a SINGLE IMAGE in your photostream, you may Add it to an album: With the image open fullscreen, scroll down below the image and look for 'Add to / Remove from Album'.

You will still have to make a few additional new albums later, to hand in work for class, and arrange your selected images in chronological order in ORGANIZE:

In Flickr, go to the pop-down 'YOU' menu and choose ORGANIZE.

Click on ALBUMS and COLLECTIONS

On the upper left look for 'Create a new collection or album' and click on Album.

A window will open. On the left, name it with your LAST name / midterm (in the yellow box that reads 'new set'),

Choose from your pictures by scrolling in the stream running along the bottom of the window. There you will find everything you have uploaded to your flickr photostream.

DRAG the pictures you want into the large window that says 'Drag stuff here'

To submit work in an Album for evaluation at Midterms and Finals, put the images in chronological order please! (Name1, Name2, etc) by dragging them around in the Organize window.

You may edit the titles and descriptions in Organize: double click on the image to open a dialog, enter changes, and hit SAVE.

Then when everything is organized please remember to hit SAVE for the entire album (button LOWER LEFT). This is easy to overlook.

To SUBMIT your work, you must notify me that it is ready by giving ma a link to the saved album. Save the album, be sure you are looking at the page for the entire album (not organize and not a single image) and then Copy the url for the SAVED album, and paste it in the group discussion topic provided. If you copy the url while you are still in Organize, the link will not go to your album. It will go to an empty organize page. 
 
PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020    Page Carr	4: Individual Projects


PROJECT planning and proposal

Please prepare a concise written proposal for your project. Your proposal needs to be approved by me, and will provide a basis for evaluation.

You will be able to work on a problem or idea related to your interests and goals, but you will NOT be able to change your project idea after June 28 because working through problems is part of the project. You MAY submit two ideas that we will help you choose from.

Your project should include a GOAL, something you intend to learn or get better at. This might be a skill such as focusing or exposing at night, or an experiment or other exploration of ways to solve a conceptual, aesthetic, or even theoretical problem of photography in low light or using long exposures.

It will NOT be enough to simply choose a certain subject matter. In other words, state what you intend to learn or an idea you wish to develop, not simply what you intend to take pictures of.

Be sure your project addresses concerns associated with photography in limited light, per the topics covered in the course.

If you want to pursue a certain subject matter, you must do so with a clear, well-thought out (not random) intent or concept. As discussed in class, a particular subject may be presented in many different ways.

You may approach your project methodically and test it. It may help to have a question in mind. If you use the same photographic approach for each image, interesting patterns might evolve. Notes will be crucial.  Keep the following in mind:

State a specific goal.
General subject matter, or general technical concerns, will not be enough. Without an intent, or idea behind it, you will have no basis for making decisions.

Consider your purpose in making photographs:
What kind of pictures do you want to make, and what impact do you want them to have on your audience? What do you want to communicate: style, information, humor, a story, self expression, something else? What techniques will work best?

Who is your audience?
If you want to fo commercial photography, imagine a client and what that client would need.
If you want to photograph for personal pleasure, think about what would provide that.
If you want to apply to Art School, you are free from commercial constraints but you should be able to talk in depth about what artists you are looking at and what you are reading.
If your audience is historians and posterity, keep accurate records to go with your subject matter, and do some background research.
If your audience is experts or technophiles, you will want to keep extensive records and approach your work even more methodically than for other kinds of projects.

These are just some examples of intent or purpose.
In other words, think everything through and be methodical, not random. We need a clear basis for evaluation.

Your approach may be conceptual if you like. Having a question in mind, about almost anything, can work. Are there any things in your world that you find yourself wondering about? Explore your questions.

The project does not have to provide answers for the final. You don't have to prove anything and you don't need a thesis.
You will need a defined GOAL.
 
PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020    Page Carr	4: Individual Projects


WORKING ON THE PROJECT

EFFORT and PROGRESS will be part of your grade basis. Making art may be described as a series of decisions.
Test and explore your idea by working and thinking a LOT, throughout the course, as you make those decisions.

Please keep a record of your effort and progress, in a journal or at least in the notes you add to images in flickr.

The longterm goal of such projects is to deepen your understanding as a photographer. Make pictures, at least a little, almost every day (or night) that you can, and then study your pictures, before you shoot again. Look for persistent themes, or habits of your eye, and analyze the images you feel are most successful, in terms of your stated goal. Ask yourself WHY they work. Make notes for yourself and go back to them.

Then put what you learned to work as you go back with your camera again.

Analyze intuitive work. You may try shooting what you feel most compelled to shoot and ask yourself what you are really seeing - what attracts you? and what doesn't?

Get feedback from your peers:
You may ask questions in your image descriptions if you like. Keep notes.

Study the links in the discussions in flickr.
These artists were selected to suggest all sorts of possibilities. Look at the work and read the artists' statements (most have them) and you will see that contemporary artists usually have a concept or intent. You can too! Concentrate on the ones that appeal to you. Take notes.

ARTISTS

Reference the work of artists introduced in the online lectures in a meaningful way. This does not mean copying their styles. It means learning from or being inspired or provoked by their work in a particular regard, or using it as a point of departure for your own work.

Set specific LIMITS to work within.
IE, Create your own rules or restrictions to keep your project form spinning out of control. For example:
Choose a physical limitation: one square mile, or one square block, or one hour of the day (for example, 9-10pm, for example) or one camera angle or one shutter speed.
Or give yourself something to hunt for or set a requirement on the composition or what you will include in the shot.
This may seem silly, but such rules make you look harder, and keep you focused. Then you can discover that many things can happen even within these restrictions.

and finally:
be sure to have FUN, everyone. That's important. Choose something YOU can get excited about.

Please keep your images for the project in an album so I can see more of your efforts and progress.
Plan to make new pictures at least twice a week during the course.

Remember to post your proposal as a reply in the discussion (I will see your name with it). It should be CONCISE AND TO THE POINT. Spend more time thinking about it than writing it, or write down all your ideas and then edit down to the main points. Include an artist please.

PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020    Page Carr	4: Final Project Exercises 5 - 7


EXERCISE 5:  Beginning a project

Please explore ideas for your project and make photographs as samples. The first may be general or experimental, but in the process you should solve some problems and make decisions about what will and won't work. Making the photographs should help you refine your thinking, or at least determine what is most feasible.

Your final project will be a process, beginning with choosing a concept or problem to work on, and ending with a selection of images. Throughout, the goal is to think through ideas and problems, make decisions as you make photographs.

Please keep your project photos in separate albums for week 5, 6, and 7, and put the date you took the photographs in the title. If you make new photographs on more than one date, put them in separate albums (number them something like 5a and 5b.)

EXERCISE 6: Project Photography + Notes

Put your latest images in an album with the date shot in the album title, and add notes explaining what is working and what isn't, and how you decided to move forward.
If you make photographs on more than one date this week, make two albums, each with the date in the title.
There is no required number of images, but 10-20 should be good if they demonstrate effort and progress. Random images that do not appear to have been thought through will not earn credit.
Choose ONE to send to the group that demonstrates the most significant progress you have made. 

EXERCISE 7: Project Photography + statement

This is the last required effort to make more photographs for your project before the Final Critiques. Some of you might go out twice, that's fine. The point is to keep working, studying what you have done each time and then making more images , at least three times.

Extra credit may be earned by doing this a fourth time, if the results are substantive.

PLEASE REMEMBER:
An important aspect of your project is the progress you make each time you make more images, and the decisions you make. Your thinking and decision making should be evident in your notes on the individual images, and your intent should become more defined.
References to artists's work, and/or the history of the medium, is also an important component of your project. Review your notes from critiques and readings.
Write a short statement about how your thinking changed or evolved, and how you solved problems. Technical issues and exposure problems should be secondary, in support of your concept, unless your project was explicitly technical from the beginning.

PLEASE DO NOT hand in old work with new numbers! If you handed in something for an earlier exercise, please leave the original exercise number on it so you get credit for it.

You only need to send one image to the group for each time you produce new work, but have 10 - 20 more for each of those, in the project album.

PHT 295  Night + Low Light      2020    Page Carr	4: Final Project Exercises 5 - 8


Prepare albums 5, 6, and 7 for grading
REMINDER: You will get credit for exercises 5, 6, and 7 only if I can see that each was taken on a DIFFERENT date (if you worked past midnight then the date stamp will change of course). Store you photographs in albums for each outting IE only ONE date in an album:
1st date 5
2nd date 6
3rd date 7
4th date X extra credit

For finals, I would like to see what YOU believe were the most significant images from each effort. Choose at least two from each effort. Put them in an album for best of 5, 6, and 7, and prepare a statement describing your progress.

Include 2 or 3 examples from each effort (night) WITH NOTES explaining what you were trying to do, and how it demonstrates your progress. There should be 6 - 10 selected project images in this album and I will also look at the rest of your images.

Each image in this representative album should have Explanatory Notes specific to the image (not the same thing copied over and over). These should help us understand your THINKING and IDEAS and what you were trying to accomplish and what you learned. In other words, describe your decision making process. I will also look at any other images you might have in flickr for this, but you do NOT have to write explanatory notes on those other images.

Post a link to the album here before class, a day or two if possible, so I have time to review them before class on Wednesday.

This will be used in the Final Critique. I am giving you a chance to show me what you think are your best efforts in progress.

I know I am asking for many albums, but it is the best way to make sure I don't miss any of your work!
Please be sure there is a date in the title of each album, the date you made the photographs.
Thanks!

EXERCISE 8: FINAL CRITIQUE

Please have your album of the most significant images from 5, 6, and 7 organized in an album, which we will edit in class during Final Critiques. (Please DO NOT put these final project edits for critique in the Group! They will get mixed up)

During the critique, your peers will recommend ways to narrow down the selection to the most significant and compelling images. I'll referee the process.

HOW TO ADD A STATEMENT TO THE ALBUM

While editing your album in the ORGANIZE window, look on the left for the yellow box. Enter your CONCISE statement of your intent as the photographer, basis of your edit, your progress through decision making, and what you learned, as discussed in class. (2 or 3 substantive sentences should be enough if you have put thought into it).
Please reference an artist.
Remember to hit SAVE. Your statement should appear as a description for the entire album, instead of one image.

HAND IN BY POSTING A LINK

When your work is ready for the final critique, complete with a statement, please copy the url to it and paste it in as a reply in this topic. Posting your set here is the equivalent of submitting your final work for the Critique.

You selection in the album should be whatever you believe to be successful, but it does not need to be a tight edit. Try to include at least one image from each stage (week) of your project). Usually most of the images will be from later in the project. 

In class we will look at each student's album, and edit down to what the group thinks is the strongest work.

I will be entering grades the day after the final class, meaning you will have only a very little time after class to make any final revisions to your work. I will not have time to ask you for clarification or missing work before grading, so please be sure it is entirely organized:
- all titles with your last NAME and exercise number
- explanatory NOTES on representative images
- concise STATEMENT to go with your Final Critique edit.
