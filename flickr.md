# Flickr Albums

You will be asked to keep your work organized in Flickr albums. 
If you haven't taken PHT101 with me or need a refresher, please read this:
`Albums` also known as `sets` are in effect virtual folders of images that you may filter from your `photostream` 
(all photos in your account), 
not unlike collections in Lightroom. Albums appear on your home page (you may look at mine as an example). 
There are several ways to put your images in albums / sets.
* When UPLOADING, you can make and name or add to an album, to get started.
* When looking at a SINGLE IMAGE in your photostream, you may Add it to an album: With the image open fullscreen, scroll down below the image and look for 'Add to / Remove from Album'.
* Use the Organizer, where you can arrange your selected images in chronological order:

In Flickr, go to the pop-down 'YOU' menu and choose ORGANIZE.

Click on ALBUMS and COLLECTIONS

On the upper left look for 'Create a new collection or album' and click on Album.

A window will open. 
On the left, name it with your LAST name / midterm (in the yellow box that reads 'new set'),
Choose from your pictures by scrolling in the stream running along the bottom of the window. 
There you will find everything you have uploaded to your flickr photostream. 

Please plan to keep your work sorted into albums by the exercise they are for. 
For grading, you will assemble your best work Midterms, and your Project in another at the end of the course in albums, too. 
I will also want to see additional examples of your efforts for the exercises in the weekly albums so I can easily see what else you did. 
And the albums you turn in will show me what you think is your strongest work. I will demonstrate this.
